# ToDo.txt to TDL

Do a quick and dirty export of a `todo.txt` file into CSV ready to import into [ToDoList](http://abstractspoon.com/wiki/doku.php?id=start).

It does the following mappings:

- Context -> Category (can handle multi-context)
- Creation and Due dates are handled correctly (it *requires* Creation dates, which I use in my todo.txt)
- Project -> Parent task. I don't do multi-project per task in my todo.txt (non GTD-esque) so it does the following

  - task 1 (no project)
  - task 2 +project1
  - task 3 (no project)
  - task 4 +project1
  
  Turns into
  - task 1
  - task 3
  - +project1
      - task 2
      - task 4

  With a data structure such as this:
```python
tasks = {
  'project name': [
          1, # project id
          [  # tasks...
              [task_name, parent_id, task_id, creation_date, due_date, categories],
              [task_name, parent_id, task_id, creation_date, due_date, categories],
              ...
          ]
  ],
  'project 2 name': ...,  
```

It only maps the following attributes:

- Title
- Parent
- Task ID (autogenerated, sequential)
- Creation date
- Due date
- Category

I don't do Priorities (not GTD-esque) so there.

DONE tasks are not imported. I had forgotten those, and don't really need them for my import, so I was lazy enough to add an awful `continue`, which I rarely do (not structured-esque).
